This project does a bit of magic to provide
an Atari VCS classic controller on your computer!

**Note:** this doesn't truly emulate the device at system level,
but it can be interacted with via the `vcs-classic-hid` API
as if it were the real thing.

Documentation may be a bit thin at the moment.
Please see an example of use in [`simon`](../simon).
